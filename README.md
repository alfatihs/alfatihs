## Hi every1!!! Welcome, take a look, give some feedbacks, enjoy! 👋

First of all, let's start from my name. My name is Azmi Alfatih Shalahuddin. You can call me Azmi.
I'm an 18 years old student from Bandung Institute of Technology. My Dream Campus since high school. And I live in South Tangerang City.
Im an alumnus of SMAN Cahaya Madani Banten Boarding School, SMPN 8 Tangerang Selatan, and SDN Batan Indah. 👨‍🎓
in my opinion, my strengths  are adaptable, easy going, good math logic and lingusitic logic (bahasa, english, and arabic), ambitious and hard worker, critical thinker, brave, and, a long-life learner.
beside that, my weaknesses are laziness, if lack of motivation, can be easily bored, havent been a good leader, not an aesthetic person, easily satisfied, and hard to be focus and serious.
And, to increase my skills and strengthness, and to fix my weaknesses, i wanna take my opportunity maximally at college to learn everything, like programming surely, organizing, improve my leadership skills, self developing, learning design, and other sciences like language, religious science, and even self-awareness.
My Life motto is keep learning and never surrender. So, whatever happens, successfulness or failure, it's a gift and we can take it happily, because we are upgraded! we learn something new! and we must be a believer, not a doubter. Be the player, not the spectator. 

I want to be an investor, not only investing money, but knowledge, friends, skills, experience, time, happiness, and everything! and then, my future goals are to build a start-up, being beneficial to others, building Indonesia through digital technology. 

Thanks for visiting!
